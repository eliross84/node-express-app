    <h1>Welcome to the Comedy Club for IT Professionals!</h1>
    <article>
        <section>
            <p>In this world there are not too many people that fully understand the mind of IT professionals.
                We are very logical and have a specific way in doing things, and sadly people cannot relate to the
                AMAZING
                humor that we bestow among them at times. So I am here to fix that. I am working here on a joke
                generator,
                of which you may visit at anytime you would like and I am going to do my best to make an obscene amount
                of IT jokes for my users to read. Now sit back relax (and I have not decided on whether or not you are
                going to scroll or click) and enjoy the amazingly, sometimes dry, and cheesy jokes that our profession
                has to offer!
            </p>
            <aside>Now keep in mind this is a process in the making so don't get bored with me yet.</aside>
